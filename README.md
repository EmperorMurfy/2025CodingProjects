# 2025 Coding Projects
Code written for personal or academic purposes in 2025; Developed via Youtube tutorials, Self-teaching, or during Computer Science Seminar (2025 Section). 

The files in this repository are sorted into respective project folders, all marked with starting time. Some of the code are either developed by me or code referring to a tutorial; Look to credits or notes for more info. 

## Project List:
* **Python** - [pythonPractice](https://github.com/EmperorMurfy/2025CodingProjects/tree/main/pythonPractice) - Written on May 5, 2025



## Instructions:
If you wish to use any of the code, follow these instructions:
// TODO 

## Note
After 2024, I decided to leave 2025CodingProjects and following repositories to only include smaller practice projects or to store code strands. Most major projects will be seperated into their own repositories.
